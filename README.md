# FASHION MNIST FROM SCRATCH

- solved using templates and recursive types
- allows for optimalizations on compilation
- not using paralellism atm, does not give performance benefits for task

### NOTES FROM WORKING ON THE PROJECT

- now, the network is trained as fully connected MLP, with SGD w momentum and decay
